### Installation
  * Install dependent libraries.  Many of these come standard with the Linux distribution.
  * Set up environment variables.  Can create an environment shell file or add the following to your bash shell.  For C shell, use 'setenv VAR "directory"'.  Note: If the HDF library was configured and built with szip support, then the user will also need to add an environment variable for SZIP include (SZIPINC) and library (SZIPLIB) files.
  ```
    export HDFEOS_GCTPINC="path_to_HDF-EOS_GCTP_include_files"
    export HDFEOS_GCTPLIB="path_to_HDF-EOS_GCTP_libraries"
    export TIFFINC="path_to_TIFF_include_files"
    export TIFFLIB="path_to_TIFF_libraries"
    export GEOTIFF_INC="path_to_GEOTIFF_include_files"
    export GEOTIFF_LIB="path_to_GEOTIFF_libraries"
    export HDFINC="path_to_HDF4_include_files"
    export HDFLIB="path_to_HDF4_libraries"

    export HDF5LIB="path_to_HDF5_libraries"
    export HDFEOS_INC="path_to_HDFEOS2_include_files"
    export HDFEOS_LIB="path_to_HDFEOS2_libraries"
    export NCDF4INC="path_to_NETCDF_include_files"
    export NCDF4LIB="path_to_NETCDF_libraries"
    export JPEGINC="path_to_JPEG_include_files"
    export JPEGLIB="path_to_JPEG_libraries"
    export XML2INC="path_to_XML2_include_files"
    export XML2LIB="path_to_XML2_libraries"
    export JBIGINC="path_to_JBIG_include_files"
    export JBIGLIB="path_to_JBIG_libraries"
    export ZLIBINC="path_to_ZLIB_include_files"
    export ZLIBLIB="path_to_ZLIB_libraries"    
    export SZIPINC="path_to_SZIP_include_files"
    export SZIPLIB="path_to_SZIP_libraries"    
    export CURLINC="path_to_CURL_include_files"
    export CURLLIB="path_to_CURL_libraries"
    export LZMAINC="path_to_LZMA_include_files"
    export LZMALIB="path_to_LZMA_libraries"
    export IDNINC="path_to_IDN_include_files"
    export IDNLIB="path_to_IDN_libraries"
    export ESPAINC="path_to_format_converter_raw_binary_include_directory"
    export ESPALIB="path_to_format_converter_raw_binary_lib_directory"
  ```
  Define $PREFIX to point to the directory in which you want the executables, static data, etc. to be installed.
  ```
    export PREFIX="path_to_directory_for_format_converter_build_data"
   ```

  * Download the static land/water polygon from http://edclpdsftp.cr.usgs.gov/downloads/auxiliaries/land_water_poly/land_no_buf.ply.gz. Unzip the file into $PREFIX/static_data.  Define the ESPA_LAND_MASS_POLYGON environment variable to point to the $PREFIX/static_data/land_no_buf.ply file in order to run the land/water mask code.
  ```
    export ESPA_LAND_MASS_POLYGON=$PREFIX/static_data/land_no_buf.ply
  ```
  
* Install ESPA product formatter libraries and tools by downloading the source from Downloads above.  Goto the src/raw\_binary directory and build the source code there. ESPAINC and ESPALIB above refer to the include and lib directories created by building this source code using make followed by make install. The ESPA raw binary conversion tools will be located in the $PREFIX/bin directory.

  Note: if the HDF library was configured and built with szip support, then the user will also need to add "-L$(SZIPLIB) -lsz" at the end of the library defines in the Makefiles.  The user should also add "-I$(SZIPINC)" to the include directory defines in the Makefile.

  Note: on some platforms, the JBIG library may be needed for the XML library support, if it isn't already installed.  If so, then the JBIGLIB environment variable needs to point to the location of the JBIG library.

### Linking these libraries for other applications
The following is an example of how to link these libraries into your
source code. Depending on your needs, some of these libraries may not
be needed for your application or other espa product formatter libraries may need to be added.
```
 -L$(ESPALIB) -l_espa_format_conversion -l_espa_raw_binary -l_espa_common \
 -L$(XML2LIB) -lxml2 \
 -L$(HDFEOS_LIB) -lhdfeos -L$(HDFEOS_GCTPLIB) -lGctp \
 -L$(HDFLIB) -lmfhdf -ldf -L$(JPEGLIB) -ljpeg -L$(JBIGLIB) -ljbig \
 -L$(ZLIBLIB) -lz -lm
```

## Release Notes
  * Updated the Landsat 8 angle libraries to utilize the latest version of the
    Landsat tool as published by the Landsat team.
  * Updated the angle band tools to support a specific L8 tool to generate the
    L8 angle for only band 4 (as the representative band).
  * Updated to change the product type of the angle bands to be something other
    than 'intermediate product' since the angle bands will be delivered with
    the surface reflectance products.
  * Changed the name of the angle band file to use _b versus _B to be consistent
    with the lower-case naming convention we have been using.
